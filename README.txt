Description: This program ranks a list of objects that cannot be easily quantified using a bubble-sort algorithm.
             The program takes two random elements from the list and the user determines which one should rank higher.
             If the elements are in the "wrong" position, then they swap places. Else, they stay exactly where they are.
             Repeat this process several times until an acceptable ranking is achieved.
             
Insstructions: The list of elements should be a .txt file where the elements are separated by a new line (See Examples)
               When the program is run, it will prompt the user for the text file's name. Once the file is accepted, the
               GUI opens up and begins the comparisons. The GUI will open with the two elements, and the user must select
               which element should be placed higher. Once an option is selected, another two elements will be shown and
               the user will repeat the process. When the user is content with the selections, they must click on the "RANK!"
               button, or else the list won't change. After clicking the "RANK!" button, check the original file and see that
               it has been re-organized to match the selections.
               
               Side Note: The program is designed to "Save" the ranking after each session, so a user can take breaks when
                          necessary and come back to it later.
